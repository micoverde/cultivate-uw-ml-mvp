# DEPRECATED: This workflow does NOT integrate with Claude Code
# The official Claude Code GitHub App handles reviews automatically
# This workflow is kept for documentation purposes only
#
# For actual Claude Code reviews:
# 1. Ensure Claude Code GitHub App is installed on the repository
# 2. Grant it necessary permissions (pull-requests: write, issues: write)
# 3. It will automatically review PRs on creation
# 4. Mention @claude in a PR comment to trigger reviews
#
# See: https://docs.claude.com/claude-code for integration details
