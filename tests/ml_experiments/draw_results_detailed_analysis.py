Our ML models (trained on 112 expert annotations) evaluate:

1. QUESTION TYPES (Classification):
   ‚Ä¢ CEQ (Closed-Ended Questions): Yes/no or single answer
   ‚Ä¢ OEQ (Open-Ended Questions): Multiple possible answers, promotes thinking

2. WAIT TIME ANALYSIS:
   ‚Ä¢ Measures pause after questions (optimal: 3+ seconds)
   ‚Ä¢ Detects if teacher allows thinking time

3. CLASS FRAMEWORK DIMENSIONS (Classroom Assessment Scoring System):
   ‚Ä¢ Emotional Support (1-7): Positive climate, teacher sensitivity
   ‚Ä¢ Classroom Organization (1-7): Behavior management, productivity
   ‚Ä¢ Instructional Support (1-7): Concept development, quality feedback

4. INTERACTION PATTERNS:
   ‚Ä¢ Teacher Talk Time vs Student Talk Time
   ‚Ä¢ Question frequency and distribution
   ‚Ä¢ Scaffolding presence (building on responses)
   ‚Ä¢ Feedback quality (specific vs generic)
