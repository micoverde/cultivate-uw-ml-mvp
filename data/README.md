# Data Directory

## Structure
- `training/` - Training data for ML models (25 test cases of educator-child interactions)
- `evaluation/` - Evaluation datasets and results
- `annotations/` - Human annotations and quality labels

## Training Data Types
- **Video Files**: Educator-child interaction recordings
- **Text Transcripts**: Conversation transcripts with timestamps
- **Annotations**: Quality indicators based on research frameworks

## Quality Indicators (Based on Research)
- Open-ended question usage ("how", "why" questions)
- Conversational depth and follow-up patterns
- Child engagement levels
- Educator responsiveness
- Evidence-based interaction quality metrics

## Privacy and Ethics
All training data must:
- Have proper consent for research use
- Be de-identified for privacy protection
- Follow UW IRB guidelines for human subjects research
- Comply with FERPA and child privacy regulations

## Data Collection Guidelines
Following evidence-based practices from peer-reviewed early childhood education research:
- CLASS (Classroom Assessment Scoring System) framework
- Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) indicators
- Responsive teaching interaction patterns
- Language-rich environment characteristics
