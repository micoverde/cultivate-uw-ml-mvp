    "video_description": "Main Focus: Mathematical knowledge and skills. Two preschool-aged girls and a teacher engage in water play at the sensory table. They are using measuring cups and spoons to fill up larger measuring cups. The teacher facilitates learning by asking the children to share what they are doing and what is happening to their cups of water. The teacher encourages the girls to look at the measurements on their cups and read them to see how full they are. There is frequent conversation throughout the video. The teacher provides information about the types of measurements they are using (i.e. \u001c one cup\u001d , \u001c one teaspoon\u001d , etc.) and uses Narration to summarize the girls\u0019 actions. (3:50) The teacher invites two new students to the water table and explains the goals for the activity and some ideas about ways to explore. Throughout the video, there are mid-level examples of Supporting Cognition as the teacher asks open-ended questions and prompts thought processes. The teacher demonstrates high quality emotional support through Caring community and Following Children's Lead.",
