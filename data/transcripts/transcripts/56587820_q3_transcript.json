The educator uses visuals to compare the melon to a pumpkin they have explored and to remind children of previous learning. Children answer questions about similarities and differences, characteristics and vocabulary related to the anatomy of the melon. The educator cuts into the melon as children make predictions about what is inside. Each child gets a scoop of seeds on a tray to explore the smell, texture and taste.",
